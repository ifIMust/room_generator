# Description
room_generator is a service that generates small 2D "rooms" in json format.
This is useful for e.g. procedural roguelike/dungeon games if the rooms are aggregated into a larger level.

The default (only) implementation creates a rectangle of the specified size, with walls surrounding an empty floor.
